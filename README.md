Control your mouse with your hands, litterally.
-
Coded by me, with ChatGPT's tips and debug. 
Note that this tool is using mediapipe, so, you need python 3.11 or lower to run it:
1) install python 3.11 from a trusted source (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)
2) check requirements.txt for libraries to install (in code editor terminal: pip install examplelibrary)
3) download ZIP and open handtrackv6.py in your code editor of choice (VSC suggested)
   *make sure python 11 is in the same path as the .py file (suggest placing handtrackv6.py in desktop), else it wont work.
5) < py -3.11 handtrackv6.py > in the terminal to run
6) have fun and make sure your webcam is on!


# INSTRUCTIONS
- to move the cursor, just move your index finger
- to click, close your thumb and your index finger
- to quit, just click "q" with the camera window visible and your code editor
